<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<a name="overview"></a>
## Overview

**Math Sprint Game** is a time-sensitive cognitive challenge that leverages **gamification mechanics** to reinforce arithmetic proficiency. The purpose of the system is to improve mental processing speed through a focused, high-intensity user interface.

### HMI Principles
The development of this interface was guided by core **Human-Machine Interaction** paradigms:
*   **Cognitive Pacing**: The interface enforces a rapid interaction rhythm, encouraging the user to enter a "flow state" where cognition and action are synchronized.
*   **Instantaneous Feedback Loops**: Immediate visual signaling of success or error provides the reinforcement schedule necessary for rapid learning and behavior modification.

> [!TIP]
> **Cognitive Load Management**
>
> The game employs a "Flash Card" visual metaphor, presenting one problem at a time to prevent **choice paralysis**. By isolating the active variable (the equation) and providing binary input options (Right/Wrong), the design effectively manages the user's working memory, strictly adhering to the HMI principle of **Minimizing Cognitive Load**.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Interactive Gameplay** | Rapid-fire equation challenges with immediate **visual feedback** (Correct/Wrong). |
| **Premium Analytics** | **High-Fidelity PDF-Ready Share Cards** generated instantly for performance sharing. |
| **Score Tracking** | Persistent high score system using Web LocalStorage with **penalty-integrated logic**. |
| **HCI Principles** | Clean interface design focusing on **Minimizing Cognitive Load** and reaction time. |
| **Adaptive Performance** | Fully responsive design with **GPU-accelerated animations** and smooth scrolling. |
| **Audio Immersion** | Responsive auditory feedback layers for countdowns and scoring states. |

> [!NOTE]
> ### Interactive Polish: Immersive Auditory Feedback
> We have integrated a responsive auditory layer into the gameplay loop to reinforce the player’s pacing and focus. These acoustic signals are designed to provide instantaneous cognitive feedback, transforming each round into a high-intensity mental sprint within a refined digital environment. Complementing this experience, the application includes a high-fidelity performance summary feature, with each shareable scorecard digitally signed by **Amey & Mega**.
