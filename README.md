<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<a name="overview"></a>
## Overview

The **Math Sprint Game** is an engaging educational tool designed to improve mental math speed. Players interact with a rapid stream of math equations and must quickly decide whether the displayed result is correct or incorrect.

The game emphasizes decision-making under time pressure, imposing penalties for incorrect answers and saving high scores to encourage competitive improvement.

> [!TIP]
> **Game Logic**
>
> The core mechanic relies on rapid DOM updates and local storage for high scores, creating a seamless and responsive gaming loop without server-side latency.
